# Description
In this project, I designed and implemented `Simultanously Localization and Mapping (SLAM)` algorithm over `ROS2` platform from scratch on a `Turtlebot3 Burger`. This project enables the turtlebot to perform the localization and mapping calculations moving in field.

# Demo Video
This project consists of two main tasks, which are:
 - `SLAM` with known association
 - `SLAM` with unknown association

## SLAM with known data association

## Software Structure



### Known Assocication
The structure for `SLAM` with unknown data asssociation is shown in the data below.


### Unknown Assosiation



## Key Algorithms

### Extented Kalman Filter

### Circle Detection

## Packages
 - `nuturtle_description`: Visualizing the pose of the turtlebot3 burger
 - `turtlelib`: Call customized library functions for kinematics and slam calculations.
 - `nusim`: Simulate the turtlebot in the real world.
 - `nuturtle_control`: Performing the turtlebot kinematics calculation and parsing the command sent to the `turtlebot3`.
 - `nuslam`: Performs the SLAM algorithm for correcting the error odometry.
