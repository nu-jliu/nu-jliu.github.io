The goal of this project is to build a robotic system to automate the process of the cell culture. The robotic system a gantry robot to perform the liquid and flask handling, flask platform to hold and manuver the flasks, a custom-built microscope to validate the cell organism as well as a web application for user-interaction and teleoperation.

# Architecture

This system can be split into two parts: 
1. Robotic Control software on `ROS2 Iron`
2. A 3-tier web application using `React.js`, `Java Spring-Boot` and `MySQL`

## Robotic Control Software Architecture

The robotic software is intregated over `ROS2 Iron` platform to ensure seamless communication between processes. The `ROS2` platform is using `Fast DDS` to implement the Inter-Process Communication (IPC), that all process can be easily communicate with each other as long as they are on the same subnet.

The architecture of the ROS2 control software is shown in the diagram below:

![](/assets/images/rosgraph_mito.png), the entire software consists of 10 packages:

 - `dynammixel_control`: Package to control the dynamixel motor on flask and pump operation.
 - `festo_control`: Package to control the festo pump to dispense and aspirate liquid.
 - `gantry_control`: Package to do the motion control of the gantry robot.
 - `gantry_interfaces`: Custom interfaces for transporting data between processes.
 - `microscope_control`: Control the actions of the microscope.
 - `protocol_executer`: Execute the high-level protocols of the.
 - `robot_control`: Launch all controller of the robot.
 - `robot_vision`: Perform the computer vision calculation of the robot.
 - `robot_viz`: Visualize the robot system.
