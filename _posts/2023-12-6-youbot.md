# Project Description
This project is to implement the feedforward/feedback control over the KUKA youBot to pick up a cube and place it at another place in the world.


# Goal
The goal of this project is to simulate the dynamics of the `KUKA youBot` in `CopeliaSim` and design the optimal controller given 3 scenarios: `Best`, `Overshoot` and `New Task`, in finding the values of proportinal gain `Kp` and integral gain `Ki` for each task.

 - `Best`: The robot follows the planned path without any overshoot and steady-state error.
 - `Overshoot`: The robot reaches the goal with zero steady-state error but overshoots along the way.
 - `New Task`: The robot follows the planned path to a new goal without overshoot and steady-state error.

# Structure
This overall project can be divided into 3 tasks: `Kinematics`, `Path Planning` and `Feedback Control`.

## Kinematic of the Mobile Platform
The KUKA youBot is modeled as a 4-wheel mobile robot, where each wheel can either moving in a stright-line or sliding sideways. The mobile platform is modeled as following:

## Cartesian Path Generator
To find the path from the start to the goal, I used the cartesian path planning to generate a 5th order cartesian path so that the robot starts and ends with zero accelerations. 

## Feedback Control of the KUKA youBot

# Results

## Best

The result for the `Best` controller is shown below:

# Challenges
- *Finding Optimal `Kp` and `Ki`*: Discovering the ideal values for `Ki` and `Kp` poses a challenge in designing controllers that excel in various scenarios. Achieving optimal performance necessitates an iterative process for each parameter. Theoretical values alone often fall short of delivering the best results. To overcome this challenge, I invest a substantial amount of time in conducting extensive experiments. This approach allows me to identify and refine the most effective values for the controller, ensuring optimal performance across diverse situations.

# Possible improvements.
 - Some script language still fail to detect.
 - Sometimes, the camera source get dropped, need to re-launch all.
