# Project Description
Used the `OpenCV` to detect the location of a pen within a camera frame, and then send the command to the `Interbotix Pincher PX100` robot arm to grab the pen and drop it at another place.

# Structure
## Computer Vision
 - Used the python `OpenCV` packages to applie a color filter in HSV scheme so that it blacks out all other colors.
 - Applied the depth sensor reading into the filtered image to get the pen location within the camera frame.

## Robot Comtrol
 - Applied the transform from the camera to robot base to get the pen location relative to the robot frame.
 - Calls the official control API from `Interbotix` to command the robot arm to go to the pen location, grab it and return it back to home pose.
