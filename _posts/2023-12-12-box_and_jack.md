# Project Description
Used Jupyter notebook to perform the calculation about physics model of a jack with a box with some force applied upon the box.

# Structure

## Rigit Body Transformation

To model the dynamics about the jack and the box, we defined all necessary frames as shown in figure below:

Then we can calculate the transformation between all frames:

## Euler-Language Equation Formulation

In this project, to simplify the problem, we model the jack as 4 point mass with same mass, $m_j$, and model the box with the mass $m_b$ and moment of intertia of $I_b$, so that the total kinetic energy and potential energy can be easily obtained by this 

$$
\begin{align*}
 I &= \frac{1}{3}ML^2 \\
 I^{**} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
    M & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & M & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & M & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & {\cal I} \\
\end{bmatrix} \\
V^b &= \widecheck{\left( g^{-1} \dot{g} \right)} \\
K &= \sum_i{V_{ib}^T I_i^{**}V_i^b} \\
P &= \sum_i{ m_igh_i }\\
L &= K - P

\end{align*}

# Challenges
 - *Solver algorithm*: When first implementing the algorithm for two solvers, it was difficult for us to understand the concept for the solver so we spent most of time drawing the process on a paper to visualize it. After we had a clear concept about what it was it was a smooth process for all of us. -->
